Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
