PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/ontvangen_controllers/controller_interconn_0/controller_enable_1_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
